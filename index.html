	<p> A CIERA postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary 
        Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA at Northwestern 
        University). I'm studying stellar evolution, modeling stars and 
        stellar populations to better understand their underlying 
        physics and relation to the Universe, with a special interest 
        in phenomena related to stellar rotation. I'm collaborating 
        with members of Prof. Vicky Kalogera's  
        <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/vickykalogera/group-members/">research group</a>, 
	    and members of the 
	    <a href="https://posydon.org/">POSYDON collaboration</a>.</p>
