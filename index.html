	<p> I'm currently a CIERA postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary 
        Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA at Northwestern 
        University). My research interests are broadly in stellar evolution, utilizing tools like
        <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/24.08.1/">MESA</a> to model stars and stellar 
        populations to better understand their underlying physics and relation to the Universe. 
        I'm especially interested in topics and phenomena related to stellar rotation, magnetism, 
        and convection. At the moment I am also a developer of the population synthesis code 
        <a href="https://posydon.org/">POSYDON</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        I received my PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Harvard University in 2021 and graduated from San 
        Francisco State University in 2015 with a B.S. in Physics (with a concentration in Astronomy).</p>
